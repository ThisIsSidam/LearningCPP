/*
We have to make a program that first shows us the list of songs in the playlist and show the 
current playing song. After that gives us option to play the first song, or the next song,
or the previous song, or even add or delete a song from the playlist. And also to list all
the songs in the playlist. Simple. We have to do all that with doubly-linked lists, nothing
else.
