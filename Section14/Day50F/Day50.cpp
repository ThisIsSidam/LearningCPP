/*
== Stack ==

- Container Adapter.
- Last-in First-out (LIFO) data structure.

- Implemented as an adapter over other STL container. Can be implemented as a vector,
list, or deque. Is supports only those three because of it's LIFO structure. It can
be accessed from only one side, which you can call the top of the stack. Hence it can
only work with vector, list or deque, becuase they have the push and pop back method.

- All operations occur on one end of the stack (Top).
- No iterators are supported, since access is only to the top.

- Needs to include <stack>

== Queue == 

- Container Adapter
- First-in First-out (FIFO) data structure.

- Implemented as an adapter over other STL containers, just like stack. It can be implemented
as a deque or list. Not a vector this time, because Queue structure is FIFO that requires 
both front and back functionality, and vector lacks front functionality.

- Elements are pushed at the back and popped from the front.
- No iterators are supported.

- Needs to include <queue>
