/*
== List and Forward List ==
- Sequence containers 
- Store data in non-contiguous memory. 
- Can't directly access the elements with the .at() method or the index operator. 
- Very efficient for inserting and deleting elements once they're found.

= List =
- Need to include <list>

- Dynamic Size
- Bidirectional (Doubly Linked)
- Rapid insertion and deletion of elements anywhere in the container (constant time), 
once we get an iterator to an element.
- All iterators available and invalidate when corresponding element is deleted.

- Referred to as doubly linked list because elements stored in lists are stored in 
non-continuous memory but one element is linked to the next one and the next one 
is linked to the prior one and this goes on. 

Like this: 1 >< 2 >< 3
Suppose the (><) are arrows aiming at eachother.

- Since it is a doubly linked list, if we take an iterator to a list element, we can
increment the iterator as well as decrement it.

- first and last elements can be accessed by .front and .back.
- Also support assignaton via initialiser list.

= Forward List = 
- Need to include <forward_list>

- Dynamic Size
- uni-directional (Singly-linked)
- Rapid insertion and deletion of elements anywhere in the container (contant time), 
once we get an iterator to an element.
- Reverse iterators are not available as it is uni-directional.
- Iterators invalidate when corresponding element is deleted.

- Referred to as singly-linked list because elements stored in lists are stored in
non-continuos memory and one element is linked to the next one but not the other way
around. 

Like this: 1 > 2 > 3
Think of the symbols as arrows.

- Only first element is accessible with .front, and .back doesn't work.
